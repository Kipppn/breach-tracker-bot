# Breach Tracker Discord Bot


Breach Tracker Bot is a discord bot that periodically sends information about any new breaches and pings any discord user in the server whose accounts or emails were in these breaches. 

### Commands



## Inspiration

One inspiration for Breach Tracker Bot was [pwnedBot](https://github.com/plasticuproject/pwnedBot). PwnedBot is a discord bot that allows you to check if emails, passwords, or account names have been breached using an api of the website known as [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

We thought that automating the process of periodically checking your breached accounts would improve privacy accessibility because many people only really check if they notice a few signs of their accounts being hacked. Although a few services do email you when breaches occur, many people use discord and get notifications easier from it. 


## How we built it

The bot was built in Java using JDA. Like pwnedBot, Breach Tracker Bot uses the Have I Been Pwned API to retreve breach information.
